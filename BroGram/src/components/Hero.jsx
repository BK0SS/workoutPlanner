      </p>
      <ul className="rules-list">
        <div className="rule-item">

            <b>Rest</b>

      </ul>
      <h3>The Training Plan</h3>
      <p>
        So this is my personal training plan that i've been following for the
        past half a year. It is quick and works around the basic muscle groups.
        It is not included in the plan, however I personaly finish the workout with a little exercise 
        for abs or lower back with easy weights.
      </p>
      <small>This plan follows this rotation:</small>
      <p><b><i>Arms & Back &rarr; Shoulders & Legs &rarr; Arms & Chest</i></b></p>
      <p>Complete all of your workouts below and track your progress</p>
    </>
  );
